import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

## set up pins
# input pin for flow sensor

# input pin for manual override

# output pin for solenoid

## use GPIO callback to detect water flow

## calculate flowrate (if useful)

## calculate total flow over 5 minutes

## Home mode (do not turn off water)

## Away mode (turn off water if flow over 5 minutes exceeds threshold)

## Persist the data for logging

## Present the data and config for web interface

## Manual override (turn water on or off? with a switch)
